# Educational project about Data Science
*We're implementing an example Data Science project from scratch using the Airbnb website as a data source.*

#### Project steps:
1) Scrape the listings data from the website
2) Explore and clean the data set
3) Build a machine learning model for listing price prediction
4) Based on the model, develop a tool (e.g. Chrome extension) to help users navigate
